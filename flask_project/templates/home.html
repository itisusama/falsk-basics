        <h1>Introduction to Flask</h1>
        <p>Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.</p>
        <p>This website is built using Python Flask. It demonstrates the simplicity and flexibility of Flask for building web applications. Explore more about Flask and its capabilities through this project.</p>

            Flask was created by Armin Ronacher of Pocoo, an international group of Python enthusiasts formed in 2004.[6] According to Ronacher, the idea was originally an April Fool's joke that was popular enough to make into a serious application. The name is a play on the earlier Bottle framework.
            <br>
            When Ronacher and Georg Brandl created a bulletin board system written in Python in 2004, the Pocoo projects Werkzeug and Jinja were developed.
            <br>
            In April 2016, the Pocoo team was disbanded and development of Flask and related libraries passed to the newly formed Pallets project. Since 2018, Flask-related data and objects can be rendered with Bootstrap.

            Flask has become popular among Python enthusiasts. As of October 2020, it has the second-most number of stars on GitHub among Python web-development frameworks, only slightly behind Django, and was voted the most popular web framework in the Python Developers Survey for years between and including 2018 and 2022.
